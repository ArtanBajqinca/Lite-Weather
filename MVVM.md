1. Model (WeatherData):

- Responsibility: Represents the data and business logic of your application. It encapsulates the weather data that your application will display or manipulate. This might include properties for temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.

- Interaction: The WeatherData model doesn't directly interact with the view (ContentView, WeatherView). Instead, it's used by the view model (WeatherViewModel) to hold and process the weather data that will be displayed.

2. View (ContentView, WeatherView):

- Responsibility: Responsible for the presentation layer and UI components. The views define the structure and appearance of the UI that the user will interact with. They are built using SwiftUI and can include Text, Images, Buttons, and custom views like WeatherConditionView and DailyWeatherView.

- Interaction: The views bind to the WeatherViewModel to get the data they need to display. They observe changes in the view model's properties and update the UI accordingly. User interactions with the view are forwarded to the view model to handle any necessary business logic or data manipulation.

3. ViewModel (WeatherViewModel):

- Responsibility: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It handles the presentation logic and state of the UI. The view model fetches, processes, and prepares data from the WeatherData model for presentation. It also responds to user actions, which may involve updating the model.

- Interaction: The view model is the only component that directly communicates with the model. It retrieves weather data, processes it if necessary, and provides the views with data in a presentable format. The view model also handles user inputs from the views and may update the model based on these inputs.

Here's a typical data flow in an MVVM design pattern within your project:

1. The WeatherViewModel fetches weather data and stores it in WeatherData.

2. The WeatherViewModel processes the WeatherData and updates its own properties.

3. The ContentView and WeatherView observe the WeatherViewModel properties using SwiftUI's data-binding features.

4. When the user interacts with the ContentView or WeatherView, actions are sent to the WeatherViewModel for handling.

5. The WeatherViewModel may update the WeatherData based on actions, which then propagates through the system, updating the views as needed.
